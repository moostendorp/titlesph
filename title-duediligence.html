        <h2>How Our Title Due Diligence Service Works</h2>
        <div class="service-step">
            <h3>Step 1: Initial Consultation</h3>
            <p>We start by understanding your specific needs and gathering basic property information, including location and any initial documents you may have.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="service-step">
            <h3>Step 2: Document Collection</h3>
            <p>We obtain essential property documents such as the Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) or Condominium Certificate of Title (CCT), Tax Declaration, and any prior deed or ownership records.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="service-step">
            <h3>Step 3: Ownership Verification</h3>
            <p>Our team verifies the current ownership status by cross-checking with official records to confirm the seller’s rightful ownership.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="service-step">
            <h3>Step 4: Encumbrance and Lien Check</h3>
            <p>We investigate for any liens, encumbrances, mortgages, or restrictions that may affect the property’s ownership or transferability.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="service-step">
            <h3>Step 5: Property Tax Status Verification</h3>
            <p>We ensure that all property taxes are up-to-date and verify that no outstanding liabilities exist with the local government.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="service-step">
            <h3>Step 6: Title History Analysis</h3>
            <p>We review the title's history to identify potential red flags, including ownership disputes, inconsistencies, or past claims.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="service-step">
            <h3>Step 7: Boundary and Survey Check</h3>
            <p>Using a plot of the technical description, we verify that the lot boundaries align with official maps.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="service-step">
            <h3>Step 8: Final Due Diligence Report</h3>
            <p>We provide a comprehensive report summarizing our findings, including any title defects, risks, and recommendations for resolution.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="service-step">
            <h3>Step 9: Client Review and Consultation</h3>
            <p>We review the report with you, answer any questions, and advise on next steps or necessary actions to ensure clear ownership.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- Optional Step for Corporate-Owned Properties -->
<div class="service-step optional-step">
    <h3>Optional Step: Corporate-Owned Property Verification</h3>
    <p>For corporate-owned properties, we verify corporate authority by reviewing board resolutions, SEC registration, and compliance with tax clearances. This ensures the corporation is authorized to sell the property and is in good legal standing.</p>
