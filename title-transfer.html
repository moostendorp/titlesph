        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <h3>Do I need to send you the funds to pay the taxes and government fees upfront?</h3>
        <p>We require an upfront mobilization fee to initiate our services. However, you don't need to send us the full payment immediately. We recommend having a trusted person hold the funds until they're needed for taxes and fees. This ensures your money's safety. For BIR taxes, you can easily pay via bank transfer or manager's check.</p>

        <p>We assist you in resolving any document-related issues to ensure a smooth transfer.</p>
