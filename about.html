                <li><strong>Licensing Requirement</strong>: Only PRC-licensed consultants, appraisers, and brokers can legally offer real estate services, ensuring qualified and credible professionals serve clients.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Defined Scope of Practice</strong>: Specifies roles and limits for consultants, appraisers, and brokers, helping clients understand the expertise of each professional.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Consumer Protection</strong>: Shields clients from fraud and malpractice by penalizing unlicensed or unethical practitioners and providing recourse for affected clients.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Client Rights</strong>: Educates clients on their rights, encouraging verification of professional licenses for added trust.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Transparency</strong>: Mandates full disclosure of fees and commissions, supporting transparency in all transactions.</li>
